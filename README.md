# AG Filters Registry

This repository contains the known filters subscriptions available to AdGuard users. We re-host these filters on `filters.adtidy.org`. Also, these filters can be slightly modified in order to achieve better compatibility with AdGuard.

## What filters can be added to this repository

We may add third-party filters to AdGuard Filters Registry. When making a decision about adding a third-party filter, we follow these rules:

1. The filter should be oriented towards browser content blockers.
2. The filter should be legal. If it has rules for paywall circumvention, we won't add such a filter.
3. The filter should have a place for receiving user complaints and holding discussions, such as a repository on github.com, or a website open to public.
4. The filter should be relatively popular, meaning:
    * if there is a repository on GitHub, the number of stars should be at least 50
    * if there is no repository on GitHub, the number of analyzed issues and discussions is estimated at 10 per month on the filter's website
    * the filter should be actively supported for at least 6 months
5. The filter should be regularly updated with at least 10 updates per month.
6. The filter should be compatible with AdGuard products. You can familiarize yourself with AdGuard syntax here: https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/.
7. If the filter works only in some operating systems and satisfies all other criteria, it will be added but only for the supported platforms.
8. Previously added filters that haven't received any support for a year will be removed. We reserve the right to remove the filter earlier, depending on circumstances.
9. If the filter contains too many problematic rules, it will not be added. A rule is considered problematic if it causes false positives or otherwise displays unintended behavior. Decisions about filters with problematic rules are arbitrary and there may be exceptions (see items 9 and 10, for example).
    * If the filter intentionally blocks or restricts access to any services for no reason other than being a reflection of the filter author's opinion, the filter will not get added, or will get removed if already added.
10. If the filter is popular in a specific region and there are no alternatives to it, then it can be added as is.
11. If the filter gets added, it receives a so-called [trustLevel](#trustLevel) (Low, High, Full), based on the number of problematic rules it contains and some other factors. Filters without "Full" trust level may have part of their rules disabled.
    * The trust level of a filter can be re-reviewed and raised if the author improves the filter over time.
12. If there are two or more similar filters that satisfy all other criteria, they all may be added if they don't duplicate each other and don't conflict with each other. If there is a large amount of conflicting or duplicate rules, the filter with more matches on such rules gets the priority.

## About filters

### Metadata

- `template.txt`

    [Template file](#templates) is used by the filters compiler to prepare the final filter version.

- `exclude.txt`

    A list of regular expressions. Rules that match these exclusions will not be included in the resulting filter.

- `metadata.json`

    Filter metadata. Includes name, description, etc.

    * `filterId` — unique filter identifier (integer)
    * `name` — filter name; can be localized
    * `description` — filter description
    * `timeAdded` — time when this filter was added to the registry; milliseconds since January 1, 1970; you can exec `new Date().getTime()` in the browser console to get the current time
    * `homepage` — filter website/homepage
    * `expires` — filter's default expiration period; used as filter update interval if "Default" is chosen for according setting in AdGuard product
    * `displayNumber` — this number is used when AdGuard sorts available filters (GUI)
    * `groupId` — [group](#groups) identifier
    * `subscriptionUrl` — default filter subscription URL
    * `tags` — a list of [tags](#tags)
    * <a id="trustLevel"></a> `trustLevel` — level of trust which describe [allowed and permitted rules types](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersCompiler/tree/master/src/main/utils/trust-levels); possible values:
        * `low` — only low-risk rule types are allowed; defaults to **low** if trust level is not configured at all
        * `high` — trusted third-party filter lists; some particular rules from there are still permitted
        * `full` — all types of filter rules are allowed; only AdGuard filter lists have full trust at the moment
    * `platformsIncluded` — [the list of platforms](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#platform-and-not_platform-hints) to compile the filter for, e.g. `["mac", "windows", "android"]`. If you need to compile the filter for all platforms remove this property
    * `platformsExcluded` — [the list of platforms](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#platform-and-not_platform-hints) to skip while filter compiling, e.g. `["ios", "ext_safari"]`. If you need to compile the filter for all platforms remove this property

    > Note please that both `platformsIncluded` and `platformsExcluded` should not be set in filter's metadata simultaneously.

- `revision.json`

  Filter version metadata, automatically filled and overwritten on each build.

- `filter.txt`

  Resulting compiled filter.

- `diff.txt`

  Build log that contains excluded and converted rules with an explanation.

### <a id="tags"></a> Tags

Every filter can be marked by a number of tags. Every tag metadata listed in `/tags/metadata.json`.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```json
{
    "tagId": 1,
    "keyword": "purpose:ads"
  },
```
</details>

Possible tags:
* `lang:*` — for language-specific filters; one or multiple lang-tags can be used. For instance, AdGuard Russian filter is marked with the `lang:ru` tag.

* `purpose:*` — determines filters purposes; multiple purpose-tags can be used for one filter list. For instance, `AdGuard DNS` is marked with both `purpose:ads` and `purpose:privacy`.

* `recommended` — for low-risk filter lists which are recommended to use in their category. The category is determined by the pair of the `lang:*` and `purpose:*` tags.

* `obsolete` — for abandoned filter lists; filter's metadata with this tag will be excluded from `filters.json` and `filters_i18n.json`.
### <a id="groups"></a> Groups

`/groups/metadata.json` — filters groups metadata. Each filter should belong to one of the groups.

### Optimization

For each filter, AdGuard compiles two versions: full and optimized. Optimized version is much more lightweight and does not contain rules which are not used at all or used rarely. Rules usage frequency comes from the collected [filter rules statistics](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/tracking-filter-statistics/) (thanks to the volunteers who enabled it in their AdGuard).

* `script/optimization_config.json` - defines the target for the optimization process. AdGuard will try to compress the lists by removing the most rarely used rules until the compression goal (defined in percents) is met.

### Compiler customization

Script located in `scripts/build/custom_platforms.js` customizes the way filters are compiled for certain platforms. We should use it if we need to
temporary change rules for a platform. In all other cases, we should prefer the default configuration.
Below is a example of the configuration for the platform `AdGuard for Chrome` with comments:

```javascript
"EXTENSION_CHROMIUM": {
    // Defines the platform for which the settings are specified.
    "platform": "ext_chromium",
    // Defines the path that can be used to access the settings or resources associated with this platform.
    "path": "extension/chromium",
    // Overrides the expires value set in the filter metadata (for this platform).
    "expires": "12 hours",
    "configuration": {
        // Sets an array of regular expressions that will be used to remove certain rules.
        "removeRulePatterns": [
            "^((?!#%#).)*\\$\\$|\\$\\@\\$",
            "\\$(.*,)?replace=",
            "important,replace=",
            "\\$(.*,)?app",
            "\\$network",
            "\\$protobuf",
            "important,protobuf",
            "\\$extension",
            ",extension"
        ],
        // Sets an array of objects that will be used to replace certain values.
        "replacements": [
            {
                "from": ":has\\(",
                "to": ":-abp-has("
            }
        ],
        // Specifies whether to ignore hints for rules. A value of "false" means that hints will not be ignored.
        "ignoreRuleHints": false
    },
    "defines": {
        "adguard": true,
        "adguard_ext_chromium": true
    }
},
```

### <a id="templates"></a> Templates
`@include` directive allows to include the content of specified file into the filter.

More information about the `@include` directive and its options can be found here: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersCompiler/#include-directive.

## How to Build Filters and Patches

1. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

1. **Build Filters and Patches**:

    To build all filters, run:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    The `yarn build` command accepts two parameters:
    - `-i`: Filters to build.
    - `-s`: Filters to skip.

    For example, to build only AdGuard filters:

    ```bash
    yarn build -i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,224
    ```

    It takes filter templates from the `/filters` path, loads their content, compiles filters based on the provided whitelist and blacklist, generates log and report files, and creates a copy of platform files for future patch generation in `temp/platforms` to compare old and new filters.

    After every `yarn build`, yarn will execute the `postbuild` task, which checks all generated filters in the `platforms/` folder. If there are no changes in the filter except for deleting `Diff-Path` (because the compiler doesn't retrieve this tag from metadata and deletes it on every compile run), the script will undo these unnecessary changes.

1. **Build Patches**

    To build patches with different TTL (Time To Live), use the following commands:

    - For a TTL of 10 hours:

      ```bash
      yarn build:patches --time=10 --resolution=h
      ```

    - For a TTL of 60 minutes:

      ```bash
      yarn build:patches --time=60 --resolution=m
      ```

    - For a TTL of 3000 seconds:

      ```bash
      yarn build:patches --time=3000 --resolution=s
      ```

    This script recursively finds new filter files in the `platforms/` folder, generates patches by comparing them with corresponding old filter files (from `temp/platforms`), and saves these patches in a designated directory. Additionally, it copies any existing old patches to the new filter directory and cleans up temporary files, facilitating the maintenance of filter updates.

1. **Validate Platforms**

    To validate `filters.json` and `filters_i18n.json` for platforms, use the following command:
    ```bash
    yarn validate:platforms ./platforms
    ```

1. **Validate Locales**

    To validate locales, use the following command:
    ```bash
    yarn validate:locales
    ```

1. (Optional) **Combined Validation**

    Steps 4 and 5 can be combined and run with a single command:

    ```bash
    yarn validate
    ```

### Repository compression

#### About

Once a year, we will compress the repository to reduce its size. We will delete all remote branches and overwrite the master branch with a squashed history. The compression script will retain the first N commits in their original order in the history. All other commits (except the first one) will be squashed into a single commit.

#### How to
1. **Squash all old commits**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn compress [commits_to_keep]
    ```

    It will retain the first [commits_to_keep] (default is 10,000, which is approximately one year of history) commits, starting from now, in their original order in the history. All other older commits (except the very first one) will be squashed into a single commit.

1. **List all remote branches**:

    ```bash
    git ls-remote --heads origin
    ```

1. **Remove Remote Branches:** Remove remote branches that are no longer needed locally and push the removal to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin --delete branchName
    ```

    Replace `branchName`` with the name of the branch you want to delete.

1. **Prune Remote Branches:** Use git remote prune origin to remove references to remote branches that have been deleted on the remote repository. This keeps your local repository in sync with the remote.

    ```bash
    git remote prune origin
    ```

1. **Clean the Reflog**: Over time, Git can accumulate references in the reflog that are no longer needed. You can clean the reflog using the following command:

    ```bash
    git reflog expire --expire=now --all
    git gc --prune=now
    ```

    This will remove unnecessary entries from the reflog and perform garbage collection.

    After this procedure git repository will reduce it's size.

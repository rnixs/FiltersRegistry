# Localization of Filters

The `/locales` directory contains translations for filters, groups, and tags.

## Requirements

   1. For third-party filters, only [`REQUIRED_LOCALES`](../validation/validate_locales.js) should be 100% complete.

   1. For AdGuard filters, **all locales** are required, meaning they must be 100% translated.

## Integration with Translation Service

It's essential to import strings from the service before exporting them, as some changes may be lost otherwise.

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. **Download the Latest Translations:**
   To import strings from the service, navigate to the `/translations` scripts directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   ./download.sh
   ```

1. **Validate Translations:**
   After downloading updated translations, validate them using the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn validate:locales
   ```

   It will validate the existence and correctness of certain locale files in `locales/` folder.

1. **Make Changes:**
   Edit translation strings in the `/locales` folder as needed.

1. **Validate Changes:**
   After making changes, validate them again using the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn validate:locales
   ```

1. **Upload Strings:**
   To export strings to the service, navigate to the `/translations` scripts directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   ./upload.sh
   ```

1. (optional) **Validate builded platforms:**
   After compiling filters into platforms, validate their locales by schema using the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn validate:platforms
   ```

   It will validate the JSON schema of filter rules for different platforms in a project.
